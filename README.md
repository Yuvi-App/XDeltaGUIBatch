# XDeltaGUIBatch
Batch GUI to create or patch using XDelta

Pretty simplistic to use, the batch features uses a generated patch list it will create for you by supplying it the old and new files.
Other then that is can still do single file patch as well to make it the go to tool for all xdelta create and patching.
